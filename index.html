              <span>1950s - The origins</span>
            </div>
            <p>
              The Recording Academy (formally the National Academy of Recording
              Arts and Sciences; NARAS) was created in 1957, when The Hollywood
              Chamber of Commerce requested a list of people in the music
              industry that should be awarded a star on the Walk of Fame.
              <br>
              <br>
              As not every artist deserved a star, but still deserved
              recognition for their contribution in the recording field, they
              decided to rectify this by giving their own awards.
              <br>
              <br>
              The name ‚ÄúGrammy‚Äù was voted, named after the Gramophone, the early
              record player.

                The Academy presented the first Grammy Award on the 4th of May
                1959.
                <br>
                <br>
                The ceremony was held in Los Angeles and in New York
                simultaneously. Only 28 awards were distributed that evening
                compare to 90+ today.
                <br>
                <br>
                Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, and Nat King Cole were among the
                first winners.

            <p>
              In the 1960s, new categories were introduced to reflect the
              evolving music landscape.
              <br>
              <br>
              However, it wasn't until 1979 that the Rock category was added,
              following pressure from the music industry.
              <br>
              <br>
              The Grammys also faced criticism for being slow to acknowledge
              hip-hop and R&amp;B, with these genres only receiving dedicated
              awards in the late 1980s.

                The ceremony remains the biggest night in music, and features
                performances from the top artists. The awards generates a lot of
                media attention, with over 15 millions people watching the
