Project Overview

Welcome to the Grammy Awards: Winners & Records website! This project was developed as part of a JavaScript assignment, building upon an initial web design project from a previous assignment. My goal was to transform a static, informational website into a dynamic and interactive experience for music enthusiasts and pop culture followers.
The site provides a comprehensive resource for exploring the Grammy Awards, featuring historical insights, detailed information on recent winners, interactive games designed to test music knowledge through an enjoyable and engaging approach.

Key Features
This is what is found on the website:
Home page: Explore a comprehensive timeline detailing the evolution of the Grammy Awards from its origins to the present day. The home page also includes a ‘Did You Know?’ sidebar with interesting facts.
Nominees & Winners: Dive into dedicated pages showcasing nominees and winners for popular categories from the 66th (2024) and upcoming 67th (2025) Grammy Awards. Tables are designed for clarity and are best viewed in landscape mode on smaller devices.
Historical Moments: Relive iconic events from past Grammy ceremonies through interactive image carousels and embedded YouTube videos, bringing memorable performances and speeches to life.
Interactive Games Section: Challenge yourself and have fun with:
Grammy Quiz: A 10-question multiple-choice quiz designed to test your knowledge of Grammy trivia. It provides instant feedback on your answers, tracks your score, and lets you share your results.
Grammy Crossword: A challenging crossword puzzle with music and Grammy-related clues. Cells provide dynamic clues, and words turn green when correctly entered. You can also reset the puzzle or reveal the solution.
Light/Dark Mode Toggle: A user-friendly switch allows you to switch between the default dark theme and a lighter version, enhancing readability and personalising your browsing experience. Your preference is also saved for future visits.
Interactive Feedback Form: Located in the footer, this form allows you to submit feedback directly. It features real-time validation to ensure your input is correct and provides instant feedback messages.
Dynamic Structure: The header and footer are loaded dynamically using JavaScript. This approach makes the website easier to maintain and ensures a consistent look across all pages.
