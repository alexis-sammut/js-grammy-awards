            When Jennifer Lopez stepped onto the red carpet at the 2000 Grammys
            in that iconic green Versace dress, it immediately became one of the
            most talked-about fashion moments in history.
            <br>
            <br>
            The daring dress, which featured a plunging neckline and jungle
            print, was so memorable that it even led to the creation of Google
            Images.
            <br>
            <br>
            People were searching for photos of the dress so much that Google
            developed the search feature to help users find images more easily.

            Beyoncé's performance of "If I Were a Boy" at the 2009 Grammy Awards
            was an unforgettable moment that showcased her vocal power and
            emotional depth.
            <br>
            <br>
            The stripped-down, poignant performance featured Beyoncé singing the
            song solo at the piano, letting her raw talent take center stage.
            <br>
            <br>
            The emotional delivery of the song, which deals with themes of
            gender roles and relationships, left a lasting impression on the
            audience.
            <br>
            <br>
            This performance helped solidify her status as one of the most
            versatile and powerful performers in the industry, and it was one of
            the highlights of the evening.

            In 2011, Lady Gaga arrived at the Grammys in style by making a
            dramatic entrance: she was carried onto the red carpet inside a
            giant egg.
            <br>
            <br>
            Gaga stayed inside the egg throughout the ceremony and only emerged
            during her performance of “Born This Way,” showcasing her commitment
            to performance art and her always-innovative persona.
            <br>
            <br>
            It was a true representation of her boundary-pushing artistry that
            fans had come to expect.
